            Why SovTech?

          <p className="text-pico text-l font-taviraj font-bold">
            The reason behind my decision of wanting to join Sovtech is based
            on several factors. It encompasses several values that I believe in,
            that alone makes me feel like Sovtech is company that will help me
            grow my tech skills. Being a new developer, is quite scary, being in
            a company that has a good and nuturing environment is ideal. The
            fact that the company makes use of several coding langauges and
            frameworks will allow me to grow to become a full stack developer.
